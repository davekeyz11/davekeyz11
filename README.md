Hi my name is David David. I am a student learning programming in Secondary School. I program websites and chatbots. I like to program things that will help us enhance human technology and make real changes. I want to collaborate in websites and chatbots that will be loved by the people and use my programming and coding skills to help others and increase my skillset as I go on my journey as a developer
